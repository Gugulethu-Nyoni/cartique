I want us to add a Settings Table for this ecommerce system where shop owners can add soem critical details

Currency 
PaymentGateway - Options would be Yoco, Paystack, PayFast, Stripe, PayPal, or anyother 
if Yoco - get YOCO_SECRET_KEY the testing one (Test secret key)
so data model must have nullable fields for live and demo secret and api keys (include as many as typical for these payment gateway services)

Shipping Service
The Courrier Guy (Ship Logic) -- 
live and demo api keys -- 

checkout_mode(demo(test) or live)

mehcanism for a robust keys storage for whatever payment and shipment service is added: e.g. if Yoco then: Yoco_demo_secret_key and Yoco_live_secret_key 

there should be a field for isActive - only payment gateway and shipping service can be active at a time
